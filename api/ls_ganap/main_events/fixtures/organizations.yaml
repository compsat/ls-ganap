Ano ang dapat mong gawin? Sumali ka na sa Baybayin!Ang Baybayin ay samahang naglalayong ipailanlang ang kulturang Filipino. Ito ang pinakabatang organisasyon sa COA (ikalawang taon pa lamang, at unang taon ng akreditasyon), ngunit marami na itong nagawa upang mapayabong ang diskurso.Naniniwala kami na ang paglabas at pagbabad ang pinakamahusay na paraan upang matuklasan at makilala ang Filipinas. Naglalakbay ang Baybayin hindi lamang upang mag-sightseeing kundi upang siyasatin ang konteksto’t kasaysayan nang mapalalim ang pagkakaintindi sa karanasang Filipino.Napadpad na ang tarpaulin ng Baybayin mula Pampanga hanggang Cebu, at malayo pa ang nais naming marating. Hindi kailangang maging bihasang lakwatsera, o mahusay mag-Filipino. Kailangan lamang ng puso para sa bayan.Halina, maglakwatsa’t magliwaliw kasama ang Baybayin!

We offer basic Computer Science tutorials for freshmen and hold series of development tutorials of different platforms that are open to all Ateneans. We also hold events such as  talks and competitions to show the different applications of IT. We also partner up with Alay Ni Ignacio, NSTP, and JEEP to spread IT outside of Ateneo.CompSAt also focuses on fostering a sense of community and aims to help hone the membersâ€™ interpersonal skills through clustering and various team building activities. It is through these, that we develop the organization’s membership formation because in CompSAt, we want our members to feel like part of the family.CompSAt welcomes anyone interested in IT. Through building a strong community with a common passion for learning, using, and sharing IT, we believe that we can make the world a better place!

    description: The Ateneo League of Physicists (Ateneo LeaPs) is the sole Physics-based organization of the Ateneo Community. United under a common passion for curiosity and ingenuity, we are a group of enthusiasts intent on unearthing our human connection to physics as our portal to understanding the universe. It is our hope that our appreciation of the science translates to the advancement of a unique wave of social relevance and positive social change. We, the Ateneo League of Physicists take pride in breaking things. We break what people might think of the world of physics – that physics is simply confined to the realm of cold and enigmatic notions. We break barriers and reach out to the scientist hiding inside every Atenean. And most importantly, we break gravity’s hold on us, as we take the Leap.

    description: From Information Management to App Development and everything in between, MISA takes management and information technology together to bring out the best in our members. As the premier IM organization of the Ateneo, we aim to create an awareness of information management and how it fits in corporations, organizations, schools and more, starting with the Loyola Schools community moving outwards. Bringing information technology and management together, MISA equips individuals with a mind for business and a passion for IT through case competitions, hackathons and consultancy training sessions. We put these skills to motion through our volunteer activities to give public elementary school students an edge with IT skills trainings, and through our consultancy and systems development services with clients inside and outside of the university. We are more than an organization. MISA is the home for the business minded and technology driven.

    description: In 2003, three psychology student organizations came together to form Ateneo Psyche, the Loyola School’s premier psychology organization. Its members are currently composed of psychology enthusiasts coming from different disciplines, united under the goals of pursuing the promotion of psychology, the advocacy of mental health, and the development of a community where people come first. Even after transitioning from the home organization of psychology majors to an open organization, Psyche still strives to maintain being a home – one for all of its members – by embodying Rogerian principles of listening and acceptance in the context of excellence. This year, Psyche looks forward to delivering many projects, including but not limited to offering credible psychology talks, psychology training opportunities and mental health campaigns to the Loyola Schools community.
