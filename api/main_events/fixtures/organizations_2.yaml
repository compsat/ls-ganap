Name: Loyola Mountaineers
Description: It is hard to express what it means to climb in words, and if anyone is to be honest even pictures pale in comparison. Climbing inspires in you a oneness with nature that reminds you how beautiful and amazing our world can be, and how much it is at stake and is worth protecting; something we can forget living in our little cities and monotonous routines. We are committed to uphold responsible mountaineering as well as form environmentally aware individuals who will appreciate, protect, preserve and conserve the environment. A weekend deprived of daily comforts will seem difficult but you will figure out for yourself--in the sunsets, sunrises, stars in the sky, maybe even the long treks, and most definitely in the lifelong friends turned family you will make, exactly why.
