It sees itself as a theatre company in the service of student formation, and by extension – given the Jesuit ideal of magis – a theatre in service of the nation. The company's productions have been noted by several award-giving bodies for their thought, complexity, and aesthetic. In its 41st season, 'Écriture Féminine | Sulat-Babae: The Women's Season,' Tanghalang Atene celebrates the woman's voice and perspective by offering plays focused on the feminine in all its incarnations. The season seeks to champion the feminine as the ultimate counter-discourse to the shamelessly chauvinistic, toxic-masculinist ideology of our time."
